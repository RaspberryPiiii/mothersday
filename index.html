    <h2>🎵 Lyrics: "You're My Home"</h2>
    <pre class="lyrics">
When the world feels heavy, and I start to fall,
You lift me higher, you hear every call.
From scraped knees to broken dreams,
You’ve always been my everything.

(Chorus)
You're my strength, you're my smile,
You've been my hero all the while.
Through every season, every storm,
You’re my heart — you’re my home.
