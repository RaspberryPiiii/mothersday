    <p class="message">
      Dear Mom,<br><br>
      You do so much every single day — from being our chef, our driver, our nurse, our therapist, and our biggest fan. You hold everything together even when no one notices.  
      <br><br>
      We might not say it enough, but we see you. We love you. And we made this card just for you, to remind you that you’re amazing.  
      <br><br>
      Sorry for not always listening, for sometimes walking away, or not helping out. But deep down, we know how much you do — and we are so lucky to have you.
    </p>
    <p class="signature">With love, always — Gavin & Blake 💗</p>
